- Does it make to multifocus on ‚ä• and something else?
- Similarly, does it make to multifocus on an atom and something else?

My answer to both questions is no. A multifocus phase (with several foci)
should continue with an inversion phase and another (left or right) 
focused phase.
Multifocused should be done on __decomposable__ formula.
